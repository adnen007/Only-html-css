# what I did

- first make a repository in github

- take a clone of repository from the romete hosting server(github) to your local server

  - go to the directory that you what to store the repository in it and type
    `git clone http(of the repositry)`

- you can call `git status and it will tell you about all the files that you modified or added`

# the opposite made repo in the local and save it in remote
